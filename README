Command to run docker in daemon mode and to bind to all interfaces on correct port:

 docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:27017:27017 itonline/mongodb



Need to add volume option to above command. 

Why?

By having a separate container that is only responsible for
persistent data storage, the data will still exist even in
the case of the mongo container being deleted or upgraded. Therefore
the database server can be hotswapped if necessary... etc
